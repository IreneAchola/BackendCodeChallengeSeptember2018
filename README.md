>Pull all changes, make sure your repository is up to date

```sh
$ cd BackendCodeChallengeSeptember2018
$ git pull origin master
```

>Create a new branch as follows-> git checkout -b [your_phone_number], e.g.

```sh
$ git checkout -b 25472XXXXXXX master
```

>See all branches created

```sh
$ git branch
* 25472XXXXXXX
  master
```

>Push the new branch to github

```sh
$ git push origin -u 25472XXXXXXX
```

3.Make changes to the fork following the Code Challenge provided.

4.Commit the changes to your fork.

5.Make a pull request to the BackendCodeChallengeSeptember2018
